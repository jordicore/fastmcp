FastMCP 2.7 has been released!

Most notably, it introduces the highly requested (and Pythonic) "naked" decorator usage:

```python {3}
mcp = FastMCP()

@mcp.tool
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b
```

In addition, decorators now return the objects they create, instead of the decorated function. This is an important usability enhancement.

The bulk of the update is focused on improving the FastMCP internals, including a few breaking internal changes to private APIs. A number of functions that have clung on since 1.0 are now deprecated.
