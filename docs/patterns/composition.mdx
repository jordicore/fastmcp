---

As your MCP applications grow, you might want to organize your tools, resources, and prompts into logical modules or reuse existing server components. FastMCP supports composition through two methods:

- **`import_server`**: For a one-time copy of components with prefixing (static composition).
- **`mount`**: For creating a live link where the main server delegates requests to the subserver (dynamic composition).

## Why Compose Servers?

-   **Modularity**: Break down large applications into smaller, focused servers (e.g., a `WeatherServer`, a `DatabaseServer`, a `CalendarServer`).
-   **Reusability**: Create common utility servers (e.g., a `TextProcessingServer`) and mount them wherever needed.
-   **Teamwork**: Different teams can work on separate FastMCP servers that are later combined.
-   **Organization**: Keep related functionality grouped together logically.

## Importing Subservers (Static Composition)

The `import_server()` method copies all components (tools, resources, templates, prompts) from one `FastMCP` instance (the *subserver*) into another (the *main server*). A `prefix` is added to avoid naming conflicts.

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from typing import dict, list
import asyncio

# --- Define Subservers ---

# Weather Service
weather_mcp = FastMCP(name="WeatherService")

@weather_mcp.tool()
def get_forecast(city: str) -> dict:
    """Get weather forecast."""
    return {"city": city, "forecast": "Sunny"}

@weather_mcp.resource("data://cities/supported")
def list_supported_cities() -> list[str]:
    """List cities with weather support."""
    return ["London", "Paris", "Tokyo"]

# Calculator Service
calc_mcp = FastMCP(name="CalculatorService")

@calc_mcp.tool()
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers."""
    return a + b

@calc_mcp.prompt()
def explain_addition() -> str:
    """Explain the concept of addition."""
    return "Addition is the process of combining two or more numbers."

# --- Define Main Server ---
main_mcp = FastMCP(name="MainApp")

# --- Import Subservers ---
async def setup():
    # Import weather service with prefix "weather"
    await main_mcp.import_server("weather", weather_mcp)

    # Import calculator service with prefix "calc"
    await main_mcp.import_server("calc", calc_mcp)

# --- Now, main_mcp contains *copied* components ---
# Tools:
# - "weather_get_forecast"
# - "calc_add"
# Resources:
# - "weather+data://cities/supported" (prefixed URI)
# Prompts:
# - "calc_explain_addition"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # In a real app, you might run this async or setup imports differently
    asyncio.run(setup())
    # Run the main server, which now includes components from both subservers
    main_mcp.run()
```

### How Importing Works

When you call `await main_mcp.import_server(prefix, subserver)`:

1.  **Tools**: All tools from `subserver` are added to `main_mcp`. Their names are automatically prefixed using the `prefix` and a default separator (`_`).
    -   `subserver.tool(name="my_tool")` becomes `main_mcp.tool(name="{prefix}_my_tool")`.
2.  **Resources**: All resources from `subserver` are added. Their URIs are prefixed using the `prefix` and a default separator (`+`).
    -   `subserver.resource(uri="data://info")` becomes `main_mcp.resource(uri="{prefix}+data://info")`.
3.  **Resource Templates**: All templates from `subserver` are added. Their URI *templates* are prefixed similarly to resources.
    -   `subserver.resource(uri="data://{id}")` becomes `main_mcp.resource(uri="{prefix}+data://{id}")`.
4.  **Prompts**: All prompts from `subserver` are added, with names prefixed like tools.
    -   `subserver.prompt(name="my_prompt")` becomes `main_mcp.prompt(name="{prefix}_my_prompt")`.

Note that `import_server` performs a **one-time copy** of components from the `subserver` into the `main_mcp` instance at the time the method is called. Changes made to the `subserver` *after* `import_server` is called **will not** be reflected in `main_mcp`. Also, the `subserver`'s `lifespan` context is **not** executed by the main server when using `import_server`.

### Customizing Separators

You might prefer different separators for the prefixed names and URIs. You can customize these when calling `import_server()`:

```python
await main_mcp.import_server(
    prefix="api",
    app=some_subserver,
    tool_separator="/",       # Tool name becomes: "api/sub_tool_name"
    resource_separator=":",   # Resource URI becomes: "api:data://sub_resource"
    prompt_separator="."      # Prompt name becomes: "api.sub_prompt_name"
)
```

<Warning>
Be cautious when choosing separators. Some MCP clients (like Claude Desktop) might have restrictions on characters allowed in tool names (e.g., `/` might not be supported). The defaults (`_` for names, `+` for URIs) are generally safe.
</Warning>

## Mounting Subservers (Live Linking)

The `mount()` method creates a **live link** between the `main_mcp` server and the `subserver`. Instead of copying components, requests for components matching the `prefix` are **delegated** to the `subserver` at runtime.

```python
import asyncio
from fastmcp import FastMCP, Client

# --- Define Subserver ---
dynamic_mcp = FastMCP(name="DynamicService")
@dynamic_mcp.tool()
def initial_tool(): return "Initial Tool Exists"

# --- Define Main Server ---
main_mcp = FastMCP(name="MainAppLive")

# --- Mount Subserver (Sync operation) ---
main_mcp.mount("dynamic", dynamic_mcp)

print("Mounted dynamic_mcp.")

# --- Add a tool AFTER mounting ---
@dynamic_mcp.tool()
def added_later(): return "Tool Added Dynamically!"

print("Added 'added_later' tool to dynamic_mcp.")

# --- Test Access ---
async def test_dynamic_mount():
    # Need to use await for get_tools now
    tools_before = await main_mcp.get_tools()
    print("Tools available via main_mcp:", list(tools_before.keys()))
    # Expected: ['dynamic_initial_tool', 'dynamic_added_later']

    async with Client(main_mcp) as client:
        # Call the dynamically added tool via the main server
        result = await client.call_tool("dynamic_added_later")
        print("Result of calling dynamic_added_later:", result[0].text)
        # Expected: Tool Added Dynamically!

if __name__ == "__main__":
     # Need async context to test
     asyncio.run(test_dynamic_mount())
     # To run the server itself:
     # main_mcp.run()
```

### How Mounting Works

When you call `main_mcp.mount(prefix, server)`:

1. **Live Link**: A live connection is established between `main_mcp` and the `subserver`.
2. **Dynamic Updates**: Changes made to the `subserver` (e.g., adding new tools) **will be reflected** immediately when accessing components through `main_mcp`.
3. **Lifespan Management**: The `subserver`'s `lifespan` context **is automatically managed** and executed within the `main_mcp`'s lifespan.
4. **Delegation**: Requests for components matching the prefix are delegated to the subserver at runtime.

The same prefixing rules apply as with `import_server` for naming tools, resources, templates, and prompts.

### Customizing Separators

Similar to `import_server`, you can customize the separators for the prefixed names and URIs:

```python
main_mcp.mount(
    prefix="api",
    app=some_subserver,
    tool_separator="/",       # Tool name becomes: "api/sub_tool_name"
    resource_separator=":",   # Resource URI becomes: "api:data://sub_resource"
    prompt_separator="."      # Prompt name becomes: "api.sub_prompt_name"
)
```

## Comparing Import and Mount

| Feature | `import_server` | `mount` |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| **Synchronicity** | Async (must be awaited) | Sync |
| **Composition Type** | One-time copy (static) | Live link (dynamic) |
| **Updates** | Changes to subserver NOT reflected | Changes to subserver immediately reflected |
| **Lifespan** | Not managed | Automatically managed |
| **Best For** | Bundling finalized components | Modular runtime composition |

## Example: Modular Application

Here's how a modular application might use `import_server`:

```python
# modules/text_utils.py
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from typing import list

text_mcp = FastMCP(name="TextUtilities")

@text_mcp.tool()
def count_words(text: str) -> int:
    """Counts words in a text."""
    return len(text.split())

@text_mcp.resource("resource://stopwords")
def get_stopwords() -> list[str]:
    """Return a list of common stopwords."""
    return ["the", "a", "is", "in"]

# ------------------------------
# modules/data_api.py
from fastmcp import FastMCP
import random
from typing import dict

data_mcp = FastMCP(name="DataAPI")

@data_mcp.tool()
def fetch_record(record_id: int) -> dict:
    """Fetches a dummy data record."""
    return {"id": record_id, "value": random.random()}

@data_mcp.resource("data://schema/{table}")
def get_table_schema(table: str) -> dict:
    """Provides a dummy schema for a table."""
    return {"table": table, "columns": ["id", "value"]}

# ------------------------------
# main_app.py
from fastmcp import FastMCP
import asyncio
from modules.text_utils import text_mcp  # Import server instances
from modules.data_api import data_mcp

app = FastMCP(name="MainApplication")

# Setup function for async imports
async def setup():
    # Import the utility servers
    await app.import_server("text", text_mcp)
    await app.import_server("data", data_mcp)

@app.tool()
def process_and_analyze(record_id: int) -> str:
    """Fetches a record and analyzes its string representation."""
    # In a real application, you'd use proper methods to interact between
    # imported tools rather than accessing internal managers
    
    # Get record data
    record = {"id": record_id, "value": random.random()}
    
    # Count words in the record string representation
    word_count = len(str(record).split())
    
    return (
        f"Record {record_id} has {word_count} words in its string "
        f"representation."
    )

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Run async setup before starting the server
    asyncio.run(setup())
    # Run the server
    app.run()
```

Now, running `main_app.py` starts a server that exposes:
- `text_count_words`
- `data_fetch_record`
- `process_and_analyze`
- `text+resource://stopwords`
- `data+data://schema/{table}` (template)

This pattern promotes code organization and reuse within your FastMCP projects.
